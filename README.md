# ⚙️ Deep Learning Internals: From Perceptron to GPT

Implementing the core ideas of deep learning **from scratch, in code**, following the path from a single perceptron to feed-forward networks, word embeddings, RNNs, LSTM/GRU, attention, the Transformer, BERT, and GPT.

Every concept in my course notes gets a matching implementation here: first by hand in **NumPy** so the math is visible, then compared against **PyTorch** to confirm it is correct.

> 📌 This repo is a **living project**. I add code, experiments, and notes as I work through each topic.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Implement every model in the course from first principles, not just call a library.
* Derive and code backpropagation by hand, then verify it with gradient checking and PyTorch autograd.
* Understand why each architecture exists: what broke in the previous one and how the next one fixes it.
* Count parameters and memory by hand for every model, and confirm the numbers in code.
* Build up to a working Transformer, a BERT-style encoder, and a GPT-style decoder.
* Finish with the course project: an LLM + verifier loop for NP-complete problems.
* Keep a clear record of progress through regular commits.

## 🧭 The big picture

Each model fixes a weakness of the one before it:

```text
Perceptron → FFNN + Backprop → Word2Vec → RNN → LSTM / GRU → Seq2Seq + Attention → Transformer → BERT / GPT
```

| From → To | What broke | What fixed it |
|---|---|---|
| Perceptron → FFNN | Cannot learn non-linearly separable data; no way to train hidden units | Differentiable activations + backpropagation |
| FFNN → RNN | Fixed input/output size; no memory across positions | Reused cell with a hidden state carried over time |
| RNN → LSTM / GRU | Vanishing and exploding gradients | Gated cell state with a near-identity gradient path |
| LSTM → Seq2Seq + Attention | Whole input squeezed into one vector | Decoder looks at all encoder states, weighted by relevance |
| Attention → Transformer | Still sequential and slow; encoder side not improved | Self-attention in parallel + positional embeddings |
| Transformer → BERT / GPT | One architecture does not fit every task | Keep only the encoder (understanding) or only the decoder (generation) |

Each topic folder has a `README.md` listing its sub-topics. Each sub-topic folder has its own `README.md` with a short explanation, a checklist of what to implement, and space for notes, plots, and results.

## 🛠️ Tech stack

* Python
* NumPy (from-scratch implementations)
* PyTorch (verification and larger models)
* Matplotlib (plots and attention heatmaps)
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 🧪 How I implement each topic

1. Write the math in the sub-topic README (equations and shapes).
2. Implement it from scratch in NumPy.
3. Verify it: gradient checking, shape checks, parameter-count checks, or comparison with the PyTorch equivalent.
4. Run a small experiment and save a plot or result table.
5. Tick the box in the tracker and add a line to the progress log.

---

## 📆 Daily progress

I aim for at least one meaningful commit per working session: a new implementation, a bug fix, an experiment, or notes.

```text
Complete 02/03: backprop for the output layer with gradient check
Add 05/04: vanishing gradient experiment and plots
Update README progress tracker
